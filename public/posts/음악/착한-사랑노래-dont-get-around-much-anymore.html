<br>Missed the Saturday dance
<br>Heard they crowded the floor
<br>Couldn&rsquo;t bear it without you
<br>Don&rsquo;t get around much anymore
<br>
<br>Thought I&rsquo;d visit the club
<br>Got as far as the door
<br>They&rsquo;d have asked me about you
<br>Don&rsquo;t get around much anymore
<br>
<br>Darling, I guess my mind&rsquo;s more at ease
<br>But nevertheless, why stir up old memories
<br>
<br>Been invited on dates
<br>I might have gone but what for
<br>It&rsquo;s awfully different without you
<br>Don&rsquo;t get around much anymore
<br>
<br>My darling, I guess my mind&rsquo;s more at ease

<br>Don&rsquo;t get around much anymore
<br>Awfully different without you
<br>Don&rsquo;t get around much anymore
