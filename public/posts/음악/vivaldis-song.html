 Lady, when you love me I feel
</div>
<div>
 Home-sweet-home inside of your Sublime
</div>
<div>
 This Garden&rsquo;s sure to grow you know
</div>
<div>
 Our love is just like Summertime
</div>
<div>
 Parrots eye the fruit and we make love
</div>
<div>
 Between the harpsichords and lutes?
</div>
<div>
 Our greenlimbs intertwine, you know
</div>
<div>
 Our love is just like Summertime
</div>
<div>
 <br>
</div>
<div>
 Our souls collide
</div>
<div>
 We slip and slide
</div>
<div>
 We feel no pain
</div>
<div>
 And with our lives locked together
</div>
<div>
 We weather the Wind and Rain
</div>
<div>
 We grow the Farm
</div>
<div>
 We&rsquo;re safe from Harm
</div>
<div>
 Inside this Circle of Summertime
</div>
<div>
 Both of us know is our Love
</div>
<div>
 <br>
</div>
<div>
 Lovers from the Past with poison smiles
</div>
<div>
 All pray our love will never last
</div>
<div>
 But we are Trees not Vines, you know
</div>
<div>
 Our love is just like Summertime
</div>
<div>
 As the song begins these shipwrecks fade
</div>
<div>
 Behind a wave of violins;
</div>
<div>
 Vivaldi made us rhyme, you know
</div>
<div>
 Our love is just like Summertime.
