<br>Nobody Does It Better
<br> ( Carly Simon )
<br>
<br> Nobody does it better
<br> Makes me feel sad for the rest
<br> Nobody does it half as good as you
<br> Baby, you&rsquo;re the best
<br>
<br> I wasn&rsquo;t looking but somehow you found me
<br> It tried to hide from your love light
<br> But like Heaven above me
<br> The spy who loved me
<br> Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
<br>
<br> And nobody does it better
<br> Though sometimes I wish someone could
<br> Nobody does it quite the way you do
<br> Why&rsquo;d you have to be so good?
<br>
<br> The way that you hold me
<br> Whenever you hold me
<br> There&rsquo;s some kind of magic inside you
<br> That keeps me from running
<br> But just keep it coming
<br> How&rsquo;d you learn to do the things you do?
<br>
<br> And nobody does it better
<br> Makes me feel sad for the rest
<br> Nobody does it half as good as you
<br> Baby, baby, darlin&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re the best
<br>
<br> Baby, you&rsquo;re the best
<br> Darlin&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re the best
<br> Baby, you&rsquo;re the best
<br> Baby, you&rsquo;re the best
<br> Baby, you&rsquo;re the best
<br> Baby, you&rsquo;re the best
