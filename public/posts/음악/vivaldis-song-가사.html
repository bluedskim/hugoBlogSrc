<br>
<br>Lady, when you love me I feel
<br> Home-sweet-home inside of your Sublime
<br> This Garden&rsquo;s sure to grow you know
<br> Our love is just like Summertime
<br> Parrots eye the fruit and we make love
<br> Between the harpsichords and lutes?
<br> Our greenlimbs intertwine, you know
<br> Our love is just like Summertime
<br>
<br> Our souls collide
<br> We slip and slide
<br> We feel no pain
<br> And with our lives locked together
<br> We weather the Wind and Rain
<br> We grow the Farm
<br> We&rsquo;re safe from Harm
<br> Inside this Circle of Summertime
<br> Both of us know is our Love
<br>
<br> Lovers from the Past with poison smiles
<br> All pray our love will never last
<br> But we are Trees not Vines, you know
<br> Our love is just like Summertime
<br> As the song begins these shipwrecks fade
<br> Behind a wave of violins;
<br> Vivaldi made us rhyme, you know
<br> Our love is just like Summertime.
