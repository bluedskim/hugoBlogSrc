 Once in your life you find her&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 CM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FM7

 Someone that turns your heart around&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AM7

 And next thing you know you're closing down the town&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 Dm7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;G13

<div>
 CM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FM7

 Even though you left her way across town&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 BM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;E7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AM7

 Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"&nbsp;

 When you get caught between the Moon and New York City&nbsp;
</div>

 I know it's crazy, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but it's true&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 DM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C#m7 &nbsp; F#7sus4 &nbsp;F#7
</div>
<div>
 If you get caught between the Moon and New York City&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 Bm7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 The best that you can do ......&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;E7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AM7

</div>
<div>
 Dm7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;G13

<div>
 Arthur he does as he pleases&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 CM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FM7
</div>

 All of his life, he's mastered choice &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 BM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AM7

 Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 Dm7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; G13

<div>
 And showing himself a really good time&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 BM7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;E7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AM7
</div>
<div>
 Laughing about the way they want him to be&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 <br>
</div>
<div>
 (Chorus)
</div>
<div>
 When you get caught between the Moon and New York City....&nbsp;
