<br>Alan Parson's Project "The Eagle Will Rise Again"
<br>
<br>Lead vocal: colin blunstone
<br>
<br> And I could easily fall from grace,
<br> Then another would take my place
<br> For the chance to behold your face...
<br> 
<br> And the days of my life are but grains of sand
<br> As they fall from your open hand
<br> At the call of the wind's command...
<br> 
<br> Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say.
<br> They fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way
<br> To read between the lines, that lead between the lines
<br> That lead me to you.
<br> 
<br> All that I ask you
<br> Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey.
<br> Teach me how to reach you, I can't find my way.
<br> Let me see the light...Let me be the light.
<br> 
<br> As the sun turns slowly around the sky
<br> Till the shadow of night is high...
<br> The eagle will learn to fly.
<br> 
<br> And the days of his life are but grains of sand
<br> As they fall from your open hand
<br> And vanish among the land.
<br> 
<br> Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say...
<br> They fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way
<br> To read between the lines, by following the signs
<br> That can lead to you...
<br> 
<br> But show me how to follow you and I'll obey.
<br> Teach me how to reach you, I can't find my way.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Let me see the light...Let me be the light.</span>
<br> 
<br> And so, with no warning, nor last goodbyes,
<br> In the dawn of the morning skies,
<br> The eagle will rise
<br> Again.
