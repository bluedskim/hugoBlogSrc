<font size="2" face="ARIAL"><br>Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '97...<b><font size="4">wear sunscreen.</font></b></font>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be <b><font size="4">IT</font></b>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">I will dispense this advice now.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth.Never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">You are <font size="4">NOT</font> as fat as you imagine.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>Do one thing every day that scares you.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote>
 <font size="2" face="ARIAL"><font size="4">Sing.</font></font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Don't be reckless with other people's hearts, don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote>
 <font size="2" face="ARIAL"><font size="4">Floss.</font></font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Don't waste your time on jealousy;sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.</font></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;" align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote>
 <font size="2" face="ARIAL"><font size="4">Stretch.</font></font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Get plenty of calcium.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't, maybe you'll divorce at 40,maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself, either. Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's. Enjoy your body, use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, <b>it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><font size="4">Dance.</font> Even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Be nice to your siblings; they are your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote>
 <font size="2" face="ARIAL"><font size="4">Travel.</font></font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Respect your elders.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Don't expect anyone else to support you.Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Don't mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia,dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b><font size="4">But trust me on the sunscreen.</font></b></font></p>
